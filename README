XML file defining the syntax for the Chuck scripting language.
It's by no means perfect, but it works for me. I'm using it with the gedit text editor.

Find info about Chuck here: http://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/

INSTRUCTIONS

Paste it to /usr/share/gtksourceview-2.0/language-specs/ and it should work.
I'm using it with Ubuntu 10.04, but it should be fairly similar with other versions of Ubuntu, GTK or even other OSes.
